### [n8n Self-Hosting](/blog/4-n8n-self-hosting)

Tech Stack: Docker, n8n, Cloudflare Zero-Trust

Timeline: 2025

Deployed [n8n](https://n8n.io/) locally with docker and made it securely accessible via my custom domain by setting up a Cloudflare Tunnel through Cloudflare Zero Trust.

### Home Server

Tech Stack: Ubuntu, Docker, Jellyfin, Tailscale VPN, Synology NAS

Timeline: 2022 - Present

My home server runs Ubuntu and hosts various services through Docker containers. It uses locally redundant storage on a Synology NAS and includes Jellyfin for media streaming, accessible from anywhere via Tailscale VPN.

This setup serves as both practical infrastructure and a testing ground for new technologies. I use Docker extensively to spin up containers for testing different applications—keeping the host system clean and making experimentation easy. It's where I test automation scripts and workflows before implementing similar solutions elsewhere.

### [Virtualised Home Lab](/projects/virtualised-home-lab)

Tech Stack: Windows Server 2022, KVM/QEMU, Virt-Manager, Active Directory Domain Services

Timeline: 2025

Built a virtualised environment to practice system administration in a realistic domain network. Using KVM/QEMU, I've deployed Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11 VMs to simulate an on-premises enterprise environment.

The lab includes a fully configured Active Directory setup with DNS, DHCP, organizational units, security groups, and Group Policy Objects. It's where I test GPO configurations, practice user and group management, and experiment with domain administration tasks in a safe environment before implementing them in production.

Tech Stack: JavaScript, p5.js

Timeline: 2021 - 2023

A creative coding project where I explored elements of mathematics and generative art. The animations are coded in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript port of the Java based language [Processing](https://processing.or g/).

While the project has concluded, it was an incredible learning experience that taught me to think about problems differently. Creative coding requires balancing randomness with control, performance with visual complexity. You can still view some of my favorite pieces on the homepage and explore the full collection at holocryptic.xyz.
