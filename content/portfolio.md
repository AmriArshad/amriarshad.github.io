### [Peeper.js](https://amri.dev/peeperjs)

A gaze tracker prototype I worked on as part of my final uni project. Built in 12 weeks using [Face-api](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) with the remaining components being coded in vanilla JavaScript. Although we managed to solve the issue of pupil detection to a certain degree, our gaze tracking is limited due to our direct mapping algorithm.
