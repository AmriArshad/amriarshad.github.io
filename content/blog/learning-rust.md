After having a read of this [blog post](https://ibraheem.ca/posts/why-devs-love-rust/), I've decided to try and learn Rust. I will start by reading [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) and then proceed with [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges to familiarising myself with the language.
