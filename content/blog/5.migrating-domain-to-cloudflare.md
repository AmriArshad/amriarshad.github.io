I decided to migrate my domain from Namecheap to Cloudflare and wanted to share why I made the switch and how the process went. If you're considering a similar move, this guide should help you understand the benefits and walk through the migration process.

## Why Migrate to Cloudflare?

### Cost Savings

This was the biggest factor for me. Cloudflare offers domain registration at cost—meaning they don't mark up the wholesale price from the registry. For most domains, this translates to significant savings compared to traditional registrars.

- .com domains: ~$9.77 USD/year on Cloudflare vs $12-15/year elsewhere
- .dev domains: ~$12.50 USD/year on Cloudflare vs $15-20/year elsewhere
- No hidden renewal price increases

### Integrated Experience

If you're already using Cloudflare for DNS, CDN, or security features, having your domain registration in the same place streamlines everything. No need to juggle between different dashboards or worry about nameserver configurations.

### Transparent Pricing

Cloudflare doesn't bundle unwanted services or try to upsell you on every page. The pricing is straightforward—you pay the registry fee, and that's it. No surprise charges, no automatic renewals at inflated prices.

### Security Features

Having your domain and DNS management in one place makes it easier to implement security best practices like DNSSEC, which Cloudflare enables by default.

### Better DNS Management

Cloudflare's DNS management is significantly faster and more intuitive than most traditional registrars. Changes propagate quickly, and the interface is clean and easy to use.

# The Migration Process

The actual migration is straightforward, though it does require some patience as domain transfers can take several days to complete.

**Step 1: Set Up Cloudflare DNS**
1. Log into your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Click "Add a site" and enter your domain name
3. Choose a plan (Free plan works fine for most use cases)
4. Cloudflare will scan your existing DNS records
5. Review and confirm the detected records
6. Update your nameservers on Namecheap to point to Cloudflare's nameservers - this will be under the Domain tab for your domain settings

**Step 2: Unlock Your Domain at Namecheap**

1. Navigate to the Sharing & Transfer tab
2. Under the Transfer out section, unlock "Domain Lock"
3. Click the "AUTH CODE" button to receive your auth code via email

**Step 3: Initiate the Transfer**

1. Go back to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Click on the domain you just added
3. Click on the "Transfer" button
4. Enter the auth code you received from Namecheap
5. Follow the prompts to complete the transfer
6. Once the transfer is complete, you can manage your domain and DNS records directly from Cloudflare

**Step 4: Approve the Transfer**

1. You will receive an email from Namecheap notifying you of the transfer request
2. The transfer will automatically complete within a few days
3. You can also approve the transfer manually to speed this proccess up

**Step 6: Verify the Transfer
Once the transfer completes**

1. Check your Cloudflare dashboard to confirm the domain shows as active
2. Verify your DNS records are still working correctly
3. Check that your domain expiration date has been extended by one year
4. Configure any additional settings (WHOIS privacy, auto-renew, etc.)
