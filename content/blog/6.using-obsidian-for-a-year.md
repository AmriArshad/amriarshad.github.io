At the beginning of 2025, I started using Obsidian as my primary note-taking tool. The switch to Obsidian was a lot easier than expected and has helped me organise information, track my work, and manage my daily workflow.

## Why Obsidian?

Before Obsidian, I used a variety of tools for taking notes such as Google Keep, Notion, OneNote, and even a simple handwritten journal. However, none of them were as flexible or customizable as Obsidian. With Obsidian, I was able to create a system that worked for me and allowed me to easily access and organise my information.

## My Daily workflow

I've configured Obsidian to automatically create a daily note based on my 'Daily Log Template' when opened. My 'Daily Log Template' contains:

- Today's date
- A callout section for habits
- Another callout section to track my workouts
- Empty space for notes

This template facilitates the majority of my usage in Obsidian since I mainly use it for basic habit tracking, workout tracking and notes.

Beyond my daily logs, I also use Obsidian to manage my personal projects, write notes on topics I'm interested in/studying and keep track of miscellaneous information.

I use syncthing to enable syncing of my Obsidian vault across multiple devices. Since my vault is hosted locally and only synced between devices of my choosing, it helps keep my notes private and secure.

## Plugins

Obisidan ships with multiple core plugins which can be easily configured in the settings, but there are also numerous community plugins available to add features directly into Obsidian. I use the following community plugins:

- Autocomplete - Auto-suggests completions while typing, speeds up note-taking
- Calendar - Visual calendar view of daily notes, makes it easy to jump to any date and see at a glance which days I've written notes
- Callout Manager - Better management of callout blocks for highlighting important information
- Colored Tags - Assign colors to tags for visual organization and quick identification
- Commander - Customize the Obsidian interface by adding, removing, or rearranging commands in various UI locations
- Copilot - AI-powered writing assistance and note generation (integrated with language models)
- File Explorer Note Count - Shows the number of notes in each folder directly in the file explorer
- Iconize - Add custom icons to folders and notes for better visual organization
- Kanban - Kanban board views for project and task management
- Local REST API - Enables automation and integration with external tools via a local API
- Ninja Cursor - Enhanced cursor features and navigation
- Omnisearch - Powerful search that indexes everything for faster, more accurate results
- Quran Lookup - Quick access to Quranic verses and references (useful for my personal study and reflection)
- Style Settings - Customize the appearance of Obsidian themes with granular control
- Tracker - Track habits, metrics, and data over time with visualizations

## What I've learned

Obsidian is a great tool for note taking and information management, however it can be overwhelming at first. The best way to understand Obsidian is to try it. Download it, create a vault, and start taking simple notes. Create links between notes where it feels right and your system will evolve naturally based on how you work.
