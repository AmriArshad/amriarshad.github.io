Hey, I'm Amri, an IT Operations Specialist and Computer Science graduate from The University of Auckland. I'm passionate about automation, infrastructure, and building systems that just work. There's something deeply satisfying about writing a script that saves hours of manual work, or setting up infrastructure that runs smoothly in the background.

## What I Do

I work in a hybrid cloud environment managing Active Directory, Azure AD, and supporting Amplifon's clinics across New Zealand. My days involve a mix of PowerShell automation, system administration, and troubleshooting interesting problems. I genuinely enjoy writing scripts that make repetitive tasks disappear and keeping infrastructure running smoothly.

Before this, I freelanced as a UI/UX designer building websites with Figma and Framer, and interned as a Software Engineer at an AI tech startup working with React and Redux. The variety of experience across different areas of tech has been valuable—it's helped me understand how different parts of the stack connect and how to think about problems from multiple angles.

## Learning & Skills

I'm constantly picking up new skills and technologies. Recently completed certifications in Microsoft Entra ID administration, 8x8 UCaaS admin, and advanced PowerShell for Active Directory. 

I work primarily with PowerShell, Bash, and Python for scripting and automation. My environment includes Windows Server, Azure AD, Active Directory, ServiceNow, and various other tools. I've been using Linux as my daily driver since 2020—currently running Arch Linux—and I maintain a home server running Ubuntu with Docker containers, Jellyfin, and Tailscale VPN, along with a Synology NAS for storage.

## Beyond Work

My home setup doubles as a learning lab. I use Docker containers extensively to test and experiment with new technologies—some run on my home server for always-on services like Jellyfin and other self-hosted apps, while resource-intensive containers run on my main machine.

I also spent a few years as a creative coder and generative artist. Through my project [Holocryptic](https://holocryptic.xyz), I explored algorithmic design and on-chain art using JavaScript and creative coding libraries. While the project has concluded, it was an incredible journey that allowed me to blend technical skills with artistic expression.

## What Drives Me

I enjoy tackling diverse technical challenges. Whether it's automating away tedious tasks, troubleshooting complex issues, or building infrastructure, I'm motivated by making technology work better. I believe in continuous learning and staying adaptable—the tech landscape changes fast, and there's always something new to explore.
